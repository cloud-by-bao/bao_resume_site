    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am an experienced DevOps Engineer with over 3 years of IT expertise, specializing in the design, deployment, and continuous support of cloud infrastructures to drive operational efficiency, security, and scalability.</p>
    <p>With certifications in HashiCorp, Azure Fundamentals, Cloud Practitioner, and Linux LPI, I bring a broad, cross-platform understanding of cloud technologies to deliver resilient, automated, and secure cloud solutions.</p>
    <p>Leveraging a deep skill set in AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, Jenkins, and GitHub, I focus on building and managing highly available systems while advancing the automation and optimization of cloud operations. My approach emphasizes Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to support streamlined CI/CD workflows, self-healing systems, and scalable cloud environments tailored to organizational needs.</p>
    <p>Guided by an "automation-first" mindset, I’m dedicated to enhancing performance, improving reliability, and minimizing downtime across complex, cloud-based infrastructures. I excel in environments where technical expertise and a proactive approach to cloud support can make an immediate impact.</p>
